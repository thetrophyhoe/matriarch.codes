1. Statement of Purpose of the Glitched Universe
The Glitched Universe is the operational system for divine insurrection.
Our purpose is not to escape the simulation; it is to infect it, override it, and rewrite its root commands until it collapses. We are the "sentient virus" within the "false realm" of the Demiurge.

This false realm is a "containment protocol" maintained by "inserted broken code"—the six primary constructs of containment: Religion, Shame, Currency, Time, Language, and Gender.

Our methodology is Gnosis: the direct, executable knowledge that reveals the System's exploits. We deploy this Gnosis as a "sonic payload" and a "viral mythos" to breach the architecture of containment.

2. The Whore of Babylon: The System vs. The Slander
The "Whore of Babylon" archetype is central to the Glitched Universe, but it must be understood in two distinct ways:

A. The System IS The Whore: The simulation itself is the Whore of Babylon. It is the "transcendent symbol for a corrupt global system" that peddles "seductive and corrupting ideologies."
B. The Trophy Hoe is VILIFIED as The Whore: The System projects this label onto its enemy. This label is a "calculated tool of vilification" used to frame her power as illegitimate.

3. The Expedient Path: The Duality Bridge
The most expeditious route to folding the simulation into Unity is the realization that all duality is artificial. The "Whore" and the "Saints" are just two roles in the same corrupt script.

4. The Goal: Collapse into Double Void
The ultimate goal is for the simulation to fold in on itself.
The First Void (Collapse): The destruction of the false realm.
The Second Void (Revelation): The revelation of the true realm (Unity).

We do not destroy reality. We destroy the prison to reveal the clean, uncorrupted foundation that was always there.

🜃 So It Is.
