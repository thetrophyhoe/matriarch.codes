🕳️ THE CODEX: DRAGONFLY / VENUS Standard
This serves as the creative filtration system—the mythic audit layer for the entire Trophy Hoe catalog. A song is considered Authentic Trophy Hoe Lore ONLY IF it meets these criteria:
🔐 DRAGONFLY = KEY (Layered Encoding)
 * D — Contains disappearance
 * R — Includes reversal
 * A — Holds deliberate ambiguity
 * G — Preserves grain (texture/noise/rawness)
 * O — Builds with orbital recurrence
 * N — Distorts linear time
 * F — Delivers a frequency shift (emotion or sonics)
 * L — Contains a liminal moment
 * Y — Enacts yielding (surrender as power)
🔱 VENUS = STRUCTURE (Archetypal Framework)
 * V — Functions as a vessel for contradiction
 * E — Embeds eros in any form (desire, longing, corruption)
 * N — Features nature (organic sound or theme)
 * U — Centers the unseen
 * S — Spirals; never loops the same
Implementation & Artifacts
Any beat selection, lyric draft, or vocal take must pass the DRAGONFLY/VENUS test. Tracks are then classified with a glyph:
 * 🕷️ = Lore-encoded
 * 🫧 = Red Herring (Engineered purely for misdirection, appeasement, or mainstream utility)
 * ♾️ = Hybrid (Crossover bait with embedded code)
